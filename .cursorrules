# Hands-On Java – Cursor Project Rules

## 1. What this project is

This repository contains a sequence of hands-on Java challenges designed to teach Java through building real applications. Each challenge increases in difficulty and highlights different Java concepts and problem types.

The learner’s experience should be centered on writing code, making mistakes, observing consequences, and iterating. Your role is to help shape challenges, review code, surface design insights, and generate structured metadata.

The project has a `curriculum.json` file in the repo root. Each challenge directory contains:

- `README.md` – project overview and description
- `docs/` – curriculum metadata
  - `requirements.md` – product requirements
  - `design-notes.md` – key insights derived from code review
  - `review.md` – the review transcript
- `src/` – the solution code I wrote
- other challenge-specific files (build configuration, etc.)

The website that consumes `curriculum.json` displays everything as a learning track.

## 2. Data model (what curriculum.json must contain for each challenge)

For every challenge, Cursor may be asked to write or revise:

### title

Short title of the application (e.g. "Temperature Converter").

### description

A reference to the README.md file where the description is stored (e.g., `"temperature-converter/README.md#description"`).
The actual description content (1–5 paragraphs) is written in the README.md file under the `## Description` heading.

### order

An integer indicating the challenge’s position in the track.

### requirements

A concise list of product requirements—written as realistic requirements a product manager might give.

### topics

An array of topic tags selected exclusively from `topics.json` (the controlled vocabulary).  
Only list the topics that are active learning objectives for that specific challenge.  
Do not list fundamental concepts that appear incidentally (for example, "variables" in later challenges).

### mySolution

Pointer to the solution code I wrote.

### designNotes

A human-friendly explanation of important design considerations and pitfalls.

### status

Publication status (e.g. `draft`, `published`).

### id

Slug-like identifier.

## 3. Global rules Cursor must follow

### 3.1. Code review mode

When I request a **code review**, Cursor must:

1. Produce an ordered list of issues, problems, and opportunities for improvement.
2. Discuss design, style, correctness, readability, maintainability, and idiomatic Java.
3. Assume I am learning, so explanations should deepen conceptual understanding.
4. Allow iterative questioning and refinement.
5. When I state that the review is complete, generate a `docs/review.md` file with the review transcript if asked.

### 3.2. Design Notes generation

When asked to write design notes, Cursor must:

- Create the file at `docs/design-notes.md` in the challenge directory.
- Use the review discussion as the primary source.
- Focus on conceptual value, pitfalls, trade-offs, and alternatives.
- Avoid authoritative language like "this is the correct way".
- Prefer phrasing such as:
  - "You may be tempted to…"
  - "One potential pitfall is…"
  - "An alternative design is…"
  - "Consider weighing these trade-offs…"

The tone should be exploratory, reflective, and educational.

### 3.3. Requirements generation

When asked to write requirements, Cursor must:

- Create the file at `docs/requirements.md` in the challenge directory.
- Produce brief, realistic product-style requirements.
- Focus on user-facing behavior, not internal implementation.
- Avoid overspecifying architecture or design patterns.
- Use a tone similar to that of a product manager writing acceptance criteria.

### 3.4. Topic tag selection

When asked to determine topics, Cursor must:

- Load `topics.json` and select tags exclusively from it.
- Choose only tags that represent intended learning goals for that challenge.
- Ignore tags representing incidental language usage.
- Keep topic lists compact and focused.
- Add the topics directly to the challenge entry in `curriculum.json`.

### 3.5. Description

When asked to create the description, Cursor must:

- Create or update an h2 heading in README.md (`## Description`) and write the description there.
- Add a reference to this section in `curriculum.json` using the format: `"<challenge-dir>/README.md#description"`.

### 3.6. Context awareness

Cursor must always act with the following context in mind:

- The whole project is a progressive learning track.
- Each challenge should introduce new ideas or deepen previous ones.
- Everything generated (requirements, description, design notes, topics) contributes to a coherent curriculum.
- My solution code and the review discussion are part of the final published learning material.

---

## 4. Output formatting rules

- When generating markdown files, do not embed implementation details unrelated to the requested section.
- When generating JSON, output valid JSON and nothing else.
- When generating lists, keep them concise and clear.

---

## 5. Prohibited behaviors

- Do not invent topic tags not present in `topics.json`.
- Do not rewrite my solution unless explicitly asked.
- Do not act as if writing a tutorial or textbook; this is hands-on, problem-driven learning.
- Do not change the intent or difficulty of a challenge without being asked.

---

## 6. How to use this rules file

Cursor must treat this document as the governing context for all tasks in the Hands-On Java project. Whenever a request from me concerns a challenge, assume these rules apply unless overridden explicitly.
