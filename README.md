# Hands-On Java

A progressive learning track for Java through building real applications.

## Overview

This repository contains a sequence of hands-on coding challenges designed to teach Java concepts by solving practical problems. Each challenge increases in difficulty and introduces new language features, design patterns, and best practices.

You'll find my solutions in each project's `src/` directory, though I strongly encourage you to attempt your own implementation first. The real learning comes from wrestling with the problem yourself, not from reading someone else's answer.

Keep in mind that my solutions are by no means the definitive "right" way—there are always multiple valid approaches to any problem. I welcome contributions through pull requests whenever you spot mistakes or see opportunities for improvement.

## Structure

- **`curriculum.json`** - Master curriculum file consumed by the learning website
- **Challenge directories** - Each contains:
  - `README.md` - Project overview and description
  - `docs/` - Requirements, design notes, and review content
  - `src/` - Solution code
  - Build configuration (Gradle)

## Philosophy

You don't learn to program by reading about programming—you learn by programming. The only way to develop intuition for code is to write it, watch it fail, understand why, and try again. This repository is built on that principle: practical challenges that make you build real applications where concepts emerge from necessity rather than abstraction.

Each challenge is designed to stretch you just beyond your comfort zone—difficult enough that solutions aren't immediately obvious, yet grounded enough in what you already know that progress remains within reach. Real learning happens in this space between confusion and clarity.

## Challenges

See `curriculum.json` for the complete list of challenges and their metadata.
